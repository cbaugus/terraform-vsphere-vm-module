# Contributing Guidelines

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check existing open, or recently closed, issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue.

Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug/issue/feature
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests
Contributions via pull requests are expected. Before sending a pull request, please ensure that:

1. You are working against the latest source on the `*develop*` branch.
2. You check existing open, and recently merged, pull requests to make sure someone else hasn't addressed the problem already.
3. You open an issue to discuss any significant work - we would hate for your time to be wasted.

1. Branch the repository.
2. Modify the source; please focus on the specific change you are doing.
3. Ensure local tests pass.
4. Commit to your branch using clear commit messages.
5. Send a pull request.
6. Pay attention to any automated CI failures reported in the pull request, and stay involved.
